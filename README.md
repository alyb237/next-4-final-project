### 🍑 Resonate Body Fitness VOD Streaming Platform 💪🏽
------------------------------------------------------
Description:  
------------------------------------------------------
#### A platform where users could subscribe and watch fitness videos online. I created a scalable, distributed architecture that ingests, stores, processes, and delivers video content.
#### Powered by AWS: S3, Cloudfront, Lambda, and MediaConvert.
##### The subscriptions are handled by Stripe and users can view their account billing period. Once the user is subscribed they can stream the videos. Any user can browse the videos but only if they are subscribed the individual video page can be accessed.
