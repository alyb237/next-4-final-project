        Classic Barre Based on my most practiced and taught class. It’s a
        Pilates, Yoga fusion class with Ballet warm ups. We will cover the whole
        body, but the real attraction with Barre is the booty lifting with all
        it’s tucking and pulsing micro movements. Cardio Made to get the heart
        rate going but still keeping the exercises low impact on the joints.
        These are great for boosting energy by pumping fresh oxygen into the
        lungs and bloodstream. Mostly with out equipment. Core Focusing on the
        abdominal area, obliques, and occasionally adding back extensions to
        strengthen the psoas muscle which plays a crucial role in safely
        developing core strength. A Pilates Ball is used frequently but
        modifications for those without one will always be offered. Full Body We
        will cover the whole body, focusing on muscle toning and improving
        posture and flexibility. Props may or may not be used and if so
        modifications will be offered. Themed From my collection of purchased
        music I will make playlist from The Cramps, Iggy Pop, O.M.D., Bowie,
        etc… you could wear a special outfit if you wish! Also, I will be
        selecting DJ mixes I heard on Soundcloud and posting links to go with
        the class. If you have a mix that you want to share with me for a class
        let me know!
