        One of my earliest childhood memories is when I was standing on stage
        about to perform a dance routine in a white tutu. Since the age of four
        I wanted to be involved in movement and performance. Thanks to my mother
        who always supported this desire of mine, I became this stage loving,
        need to perform, person. During elementary school I was in gymnastics;
        in middle school I joined the dance team; and in high school due to the
        recession that hit my parents business very hard, I had to quit all
        extra curricular activities and then started running. That is when
        realized I had lumbar scoliosis. Soon after, I developed terrible shin
        splints that eventually led me into physical therapy. I became
        fascinated with the field of work and after high school enrolled in a
        P.T.A. program. Two years into the program my love for music had
        outgrown the desire to work in the healthcare field and I decided to
        study music and sound engineering. Young and poor at 20 years old I
        moved to NYC. Fast Forward to 2016, I was almost done with my Bachelors
        degree but I was feeling physically unhealthy and depressed. I had
        developed body weight issues when I was 17 and was taking diet pills and
        working out 4 hours a day because I thought I was fat. Not only did that
        cause irreversible damage to my digestive system; the fact that I was
        also heavily partying did not help! I needed to do something to help
        myself feel better about my body and be able to see the strength and
        beauty within myself. That is when I joined a Classic Barre Technique
        teacher training by Carolyn McPherson. It was a Pilates-Yoga-Ballet
        fusion that I fell absolutely in love with. Building muscles had never
        been important for me <em> I had always preferred to be thin </em>but I
        began joy the new shape my body created. Lean, elongated muscles like
        that of a ballerina but with a big sporty booty and a strong core from a
        proper Pilates foundation. I got my first job teaching at Align
        Brooklyn, a black owned business in South Slope Brooklyn, and I felt
        really welcome there. They let me take classes, and since the owners
        Christopher and Pam also had a chiropractic practice, I learned a lot
        from them and their expertise team of teachers. After leaving NYC for
        love in Austria, I started working at Body Concept Vienna. This is a
        place where I have been able to develop my classes and method like I
        never imagined. For the past year I have seen my body transform; now I
        rarely have moments of body shame. Continuing on this journey of
        movement, mixed with my adoration for music, sound and its’
        technological side, I hope to capture this for a moment and be able to
        share it with others. I see no difference when I am studying how an
        operational amplifier stabilizes itself, or when I am writing music and
        I get lost in composing harmony, to how magical it feels when lifting up
        to relevé.
